# Random Walk Process
This code illustrates how a virus can spread through a pool. Each ball randomly moves up/down/left/right and has collision detection or knows when it comes in contact with another ball.

If a ball is infected with Covid a and comes in contact with another ball it will infect that ball and there is a probability that the infect ball will get sick or die. However, each ball has an immunity counter, the more it comes in contact with a ball that has Covid the more it because immuned from Covid.
