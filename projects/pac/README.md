# PACMAKER
###### A build your own PacMan game

PacMaker is a JS game that allows you to build your own PacMan game and then play it!

## Getting Started
Wall button adds walls, Start Game adds Pac to the DOM, Arrow keys move, and S key stops Pac

## Plans
I am currently finishing some collision code, and hope to finish the rest of the wall building code by 26-01-2021.
