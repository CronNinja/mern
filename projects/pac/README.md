# PACMAKER
###### A build your own PacMan game

PacMaker is a JS game that allows you to build your own PacMan game and then play it!

## Getting Started
First select the piece you want to add to the envirnoment (Currently working on click and add feature), then press the Start Game button when you're ready to play

## Plans
I am currently finishing some collision code, and hope to finish the rest of the wall building code by 26-01-2021.
